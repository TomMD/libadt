## Scope

This project aim to help the learning data structures, so when sending your changes,
always keep in mind that we prefer to have a readable code and well organized (but inefficient)

## Code Convention

As we know, everyone has their opinion about code design in programming languages, and C is no different.
For this reason, this repository will use the convention explained on the [C Coding Standard] (http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~eno/coding/CCodingStandard.html) site.
