libadt - an abstract data types library
=======================================

### What is libadt?

Libadt is a C library for those who want to study a little more about Abstract Data Types. The library implements the most common types of structures of computer science and is extremely well documented.

ADTs are a theoretical concept in computer science, used in the design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, and software systems, and do not correspond to specific features of computer languages - mainstream computer languages do not directly support formally specified ADTs. However, various language features correspond to certain aspects of ADTs, and are easily confused with ADTs proper; these include abstract types, opaque data types, protocols, and design by contract.

### Why?

Because in C we deal directly with memory, and the structures provided by the language are quite primitive. And since in higher level languages there are other structures (such as classes and objects) that implement many of the features of data structures, there would be no advantage (or learning) in implementing these structures.
